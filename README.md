## What is this library?

> The Pokérus (Japanese: ポケルス Pokérus), from "Pokémon virus", is a microscopic life-form that may attach to Pokémon, first appearing in the Generation II games. It is a beneficial mechanic that a Pokémon can obtain.

This library recreates that mechanic, by giving your executable a 3 in 65,536 chance to have Pokérus every time you run it!

## Usage

```go
import _ "github.com/jonot-cyber/pokerus"
```

And then forget you installed it!

Now I'm going to stop because git is giving me a headache
